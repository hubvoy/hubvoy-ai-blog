In the first part of the post, I'm going to explain what robots are, what is the field of robotics and some historical background. In the second part of, I'm going to talk about different components of robots, what they allow robots to do and their individual jobs. "

The aim was to find similarities between artificial and biological control systems and build machines that would show animal-like behavior. The machines could be called biomimetic, because of the type of behavior they were modeled after. The key aspect of cybernetics is in the coupling, combination and interaction between artificial and biological systems and their environment."
